# Basic description
It is a simple laser CNC that can cut or engrave on paper. All it needs is a jpeg format image of what it should engrave. This image must be black and white. CNC will then engrave all black pixels on paper, but left white pixels untouched. 

## College project
Me and a friend Matjaž made this project as end project for subject called "Vgrajeni sistemi". This subject is taught on Faculty of Computer and Informational Science (1000 Ljubljana, Slovenija). We were in 2nd year of 1st degree study. 

## Solidworks sketch
Before every actual development stage, there are few stages that need to be done. One of those stages is putting idea to visual representation. I choose Solidworks program for creating 3D representation of our product. 

## Components
For project we used:
- STM32F4 printed board
- 1 laser diode
- 1 driver for laser
- 2 NEMA 17 stepper motors
- 2 drivers for stepper motors 
- additional fan for cooling of the drivers

## Future development
I have also started to design real CNC with ability to cut and drill. I want to convert this laser CNC to mechanical CNC with spindle motor. This will probably happen in the far future because I don't have a lot of time - But it is on my to-do list.
